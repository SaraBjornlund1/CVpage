          This is a short presentation of who I am and what I like to do in my spare time.
          The point is for you to get to know me a little better than just work experience.
          So, my full name is Sara Björnlund and I live in Sweden in a small town called Rotebro,
          it's about 20 minitues away from our capital, Stockholm. I live with my lovely partner Winston,
          which is a cat - And ofcourse my other beloved partner Henrik. Henrik and I have been togheter
          for 3 years now in this new year! You can see some pictures of Henrik and our cat in the home menu.</p><br>
        <p class="lead">
          I really like the color <span style="color:hotpink">pink</span>, in other words I have alot
          of <span style="color:hotpink">pink</span> dresses and clothes.. It's a nice color! My
          favorite time of the year is the summer. The sun and the warmth is breathtaking! when i'm free and got
          some time over at home I am a gamer girl. I like all kind of games on PC and console. The best console
          is Playstation! I even like board games, I can recommend on card game called 'Cards against Humanity',
          really fun with some friends!</p><br>
        <p class="lead">
          On holidays I like to spend my time and traveling togheter with Henrik. I like to
          experience new food, culture and see some new places. Total in my life so far I have been to
          11 different countries and total been abroad 17 times. My favorite country so far is Greece.
          Lovely people and good food! Love the envoiroment of the blue sea and some rocks to take a bath from.</p><br>
        <p class="lead">
          In august this year (2018) I started to go to school at Nackademin in Sweden where I someday will be a
          fullstack
          programmer. The education I study is Web development .NET with CMS. Right now im looking for a internship
          for the start of 2020. It's a while there but this internship is 20 weeks long and it's better to be out in
          good time.</p><br>
        <p class="lead">
          Please, feel free to contact me if you are in need of web developer as a trainee.
          You can see my contact information in the menu top.</p><br><br>
        <p class="lead">
          Kind regards, Sara</p>
